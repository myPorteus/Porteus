1 About LibGTop
***************

LibGTop is a library to get system specific data such as CPU and Memory
Usage and information about running Processes.

   On Systems like Solaris or Digital Unix where you need special
privileges to get those data, it uses a setuid/setgid server to do so.

   Even if LibGTop is a part of the GNOME desktop environment
(<http://www.gnome.org>), the main interface of LibGTop is totally
independent from any particular desktop environment, so you can also use
it as a standalone library in any piece of GPLed software.

1.1 Availability
================

The master source of LibGTop is the GNOME CVS tree (see
<http://www.gnome.org> for details), but you can also get the latest
release tarballs from

     <ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgtop/>

or any of its mirror sites.

   The latest stable version of LibGTop is 1.0.12 which is also the one
that comes together with GNOME 1.0.  It belongs to 'LIBGTOP_STABLE_1_0'
branch in CVS. Actual development occurs in the 'libgtop-GNOME-2-0-port'
which is currently versioned 1.90.0.


File: libgtop2.info,  Node: Supported Platforms,  Next: Mailing List,  Prev: Availability,  Up: About

1.2 Supported Platforms
=======================

The stable branch currently supports the following platforms:

   * All versions of Linux

     LibGTop was tested under Linux 2.0.x and 2.2.x on the ix86 and the
     alpha, but it should also work without problems on SparcLinux or
     Linux 2.4.x.

     Note: I'm speaking of the Linux kernel here, not the GNU/Linux
     operating system.

   * FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD

     LibGTop was tested under FreeBSD 2.2.6 and 3.0, NetBSD 1.3.2 and
     OpenBSD 2.4.  Support for NetBSD 1.4 was added in LibGTop 1.0.2.

   The platforms listed above are known to be stable and working.
However, if you're using the latest development version, you can use it
on the following platforms as well:

   * BSD/OS

     There is a port for BSD/OS (aka BSDI) 2.x and 3.x from Timur
     Bakeyev which should also work with 4.x.  This isn't tested very
     well, but it should be working.

   * Digital Unix

     There is some basic support for Digital Unix (formerly DEC OSF/1)
     V3.2C, but this may still be a bit unstable.  I'm currently working
     on this port as time permits so it should be fully supported soon.

   * Solaris

     The Solaris port currently works on Solaris 7 and maybe also on
     other releases.  Thanks a lot to Drazen Kacar and everyone who
     helped working on this port.  They have really done excellent work
     here and I'm pretty sure that this port will be fully functional on
     most Solaris versions in near future.

1.3 Mailing List
================

There is a <libgtop-devel-list@egroups.com> mailing list for people who
want to help with the development of LibGTop.

   It is meant as a low-traffic, but high content-list where we can
discuss technical details such as adding new sysdeps ports etc.

   Especially, I'd like to see people with a deeper knowledge of
operating systems internals joining my list so we can discuss technical
details of the sysdeps code.

   It is *not* for users that want to know how to compile LibGTop etc.

   You can subscribe to this mailing list and view the mailing list
archives on the LibGTop Page at
<http://www.home-of-linux.org/gnome/libgtop>.

File: libgtop2.info,  Node: Introduction,  Next: Overview,  Prev: White Paper,  Up: White Paper

2.1 Introduction
================

Many modern UNIX systems like Solaris, BSD or Digitial Unix only allow
priviledged processes to read information like CPU and Memory Usage or
information about running processes.

   * BSD, for instance, doesn't have any other way to get those data
     than reading directly from '/dev/kmem' and you need to be in the
     'kmem' group to be able to read this.

   * Other systems, like Digital Unix, allow all users to get things
     like CPU and Memory statistics, but only root may read information
     about any process other than the current one (you may not even get
     information about your own processes if you're not root).

   * Linux has a very nice '/proc' filesystem, but reading and parsing
     '/proc' is very slow and inefficient.

   * Solaris is a bit better, but you still need to be in the 'sys'
     group or even root to get some data.

   Because of this system utilities like 'ps', 'uptime' or 'top' often
are setgid kmem or setuid root.  Usually, they're also very specific to
the system they're written for and not easily portable to other systems
without a lot of work.

   This, of cause, becomes a problem for graphical tools like 'gtop' -
making a GTK+ program setgid or even setuid would be a security hole as
big as you can drive the entire X11 source code through.  For the GNOME
project, we also needed some kind of library which provides all the
required information in a portable since there's more than just one
single program that wants to use them - for instance 'gtop' and the
'multiload', 'cpumemusage' and 'netload' panel applets.

2.2 Overview
============

This section should give you a short overview on how LibGTop was
developed, which things needed to be considered and how it works.

* Menu:

* Interface Design::            Things that need to be considered
* Server Implementation::       The LibGTop "server"


File: libgtop2.info,  Node: Interface Design,  Next: Server Implementation,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Overview

2.2.1 Interface Design
----------------------

At the very beginning, it was necessary to collect all the data the
library part should provide and put them into some C structures.  This
was not that easiy as it might sound since LibGTop should be portable to
any modern UNIX system with a common library part on all those systems,
but the data that should be returned vary from system to system.  For
instance some systems support shared memory, but some others may not.

   The header files where we define these C structures (which are
system-independent) are shared between client and server.  This way we
can call the system dependent code directly where we do not need any
special privileges to do so.

   All of those structures contain a 'flags' member which is interpreted
as a bit mask and tells the caller of the library functions which of the
fields in the returned structure are valid and which are not.


File: libgtop2.info,  Node: Server Implementation,  Prev: Interface Design,  Up: Overview

2.2.2 Server Implementation
---------------------------

The LibGTop "server" is a setgid/setuid binary which contains all the
system dependent code which needs special privileges.  It is only build
if it's required on the current system (for instance, the Linux kernel
provides all the required data via its '/proc' filesystem so we do not
need the server at all) and it only contains the "features" which need
privileges.

   Whenever we do not need any privileges to get all the data for some
of the requested structures (here called "features") the library calls
the sysdeps code directly rather than using the server.

3.1.1 CPU Usage
---------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_cpu':

     void glibtop_get_cpu (glibtop_cpu *buf);
     void glibtop_get_cpu_l (glibtop *server, glibtop_cpu *buf);

   Declaration of 'glibtop_cpu' in '<glibtop/cpu.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_cpu     glibtop_cpu;

     struct _glibtop_cpu
     {
         guint64   flags,
             total,
             user,
             nice,
             sys,
             idle,
             iowait,
             irq,
             softirq,
             frequency,
             xcpu_total [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_user [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_nice [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_sys  [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_idle [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_iowait [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_irq [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_softirq [GLIBTOP_NCPU],
             xcpu_flags;
     };

   All CPU units are measured in "jiffies" which are normally 1/100th of
a second (in which case 'frequency' equals 100), but can also be in any
other unit.  To get seconds, divide them by 'frequency'.

'total'
     Number of clock ticks since system boot.

'user'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent in user mode.

'nice'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent in user mode (nice).

'sys'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent in system mode.

'idle'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent in the idle task.

'iowait'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent waiting for I/O to complete.

'irq'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent servicing interrupts.

'softirq'
     Number of clock ticks the system spent servicing softirqs.

'frequency'
     Tick frequency (default is 100).

   The 'xcpu_' values are for SMP systems - they are the same than
'total', 'user', 'nice', 'sys', 'idle', 'iowait', 'irq' and 'softirq'
except that they are arrays of 'GLIBTOP_NCPU' (defined in
'<glibtop/cpu.h>') elements and contain one value for each CPU in the
system.

'xcpu_flags'
     This is interpreted as a bit-field: on systems like Solaris, not
     all CPUs need to be running all the time, so we set the
     corresponding bit for each CPU that is currently running.

   Please note that all of the cpu values are absolute values measured
in certain units (to get seconds, divide them by 'frequency') since
system boot.  To get percentual values, you need to call 'glibtop_cpu',
save the result, wait some time and then call it again and divide the
differences of the two values by the time you have waited.

3.1.2 Memory Usage
------------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_mem':

     void glibtop_get_mem (glibtop_mem *buf);
     void glibtop_get_mem_l (glibtop *server, glibtop_mem *buf);

   Declaration of 'glibtop_mem' in '<glibtop/mem.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_mem     glibtop_mem;

     struct _glibtop_mem
     {
         guint64   flags,
             total,
             used,
             free,
             shared,
             buffer,
             cached,
             user,
             locked;
     };

   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all memory units are in bytes.

'total'
     Total physical memory.

'used'
     Used memory size.

'free'
     Free memory size.

'shared'
     Shared memory size.

     This are both segments that are 'mmap()'ed with 'MAP_SHARED' and
     IPC Shared Memory segments.

'buffer'
     Size of buffers.

'cached'
     Size of cached memory.

'user'
     Memory used from user processes.

     This is normally 'total - free - shared - buffer - cached'.

'locked'
     Memory in locked segments.

3.1.3 Swap Usage
----------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_swap':

     void glibtop_get_swap (glibtop_swap *buf);
     void glibtop_get_swap_l (glibtop *server, glibtop_swap *buf);

   Declaration of 'glibtop_swap' in '<glibtop/swap.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_swap    glibtop_swap;

     struct _glibtop_swap
     {
         guint64   flags,
             total,
             used,
             free,
             pagein,
             pageout;
     };

   The following units are in bytes.

'total'
     Total swap space in the system.

'used'
     Used swap space.

'free'
     Free swap space.

   You can use 'pagein' and 'pageout' to get some measure about how much
the system is swapping at the moment.  They're increased each time a
page is swapped in or out, so you need to save this values, wait a
little bit, get them again and then compare the two results to find out
how much the system swapped in the meantime.

'pagein'
     Total number of swap pages that have been brought in since system
     boot

'pageout'
     Total number of swap pages that have been brought out since system
     boot


File: libgtop2.info,  Node: glibtop_uptime,  Next: glibtop_loadavg,  Prev: glibtop_swap,  Up: System Dependent

3.1.4 Uptime
------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_uptime':

     void glibtop_get_uptime (glibtop_uptime *buf);
     void glibtop_get_uptime_l (glibtop *server, glibtop_uptime *buf);

   Declaration of 'glibtop_uptime' in '<glibtop/uptime.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_uptime  glibtop_uptime;

     struct _glibtop_uptime
     {
         guint64 flags;
         double uptime,
             idletime;
         guint64 boot_time;
     };

   When porting LibGTop to a new system, you only need to implement
'uptime' and 'idletime' if there's a faster or better way to obtain them
as using 'glibtop_cpu' for it.  Look at 'sysdeps/freebsd/uptime.c' for
an example on how to obtain them using 'glibtop_cpu'.

'uptime'
     Time in seconds since system boot.

'idletime'
     Time in seconds the system spent in the idle task since system
     boot.

   The following one was from a request on the 'linux-kernel' mailing
list; on a laptop with advanced power management 'glibtop_cpu.total' may
not reflect the correct boot time of the system if the power was turned
off by means of APM in the meantime.

'boot_time'
     Time of last system boot in seconds since the epoch.

3.1.5 Load Average
------------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_loadavg':

     void glibtop_get_loadavg (glibtop_loadavg *buf);
     void glibtop_get_loadavg_l (glibtop *server, glibtop_loadavg *buf);

   Declaration of 'glibtop_loadavg' in '<glibtop/loadavg.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_loadavg glibtop_loadavg;

     struct _glibtop_loadavg
     {
         guint64 flags;
         double loadavg [3];
         guint64 nr_running,
             nr_tasks,
             last_pid;
     };

'loadavg'

     Number of jobs running simultaneously averaged over 1, 5 and 15
     minutes.

   The following fields are Linux specific and deprecated.  You don't
need to implement them when porting LibGTop to a new system as they may
be removed in a future version.

'nr_running'
     Number of tasks currently running.

'nr_tasks'
     Total number of tasks.

'last_pid'
     Last PID.

   Declaration of 'glibtop_proclist' in '<glibtop/proclist.h>':

     typedef struct _glibtop_proclist        glibtop_proclist;

     struct _glibtop_proclist
     {
         guint64   flags,

     };

   This function returns a list of all or a selected subset of all
running processes.  You can use the 'which' and 'arg' arguments to
specify which processes should be returned.

   You can use the following values for the 'which' argument:

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_ALL'
     Return information about all processes (the 'arg' argument is
     ignored).

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_PID'
     Return information about all process with the pid PID which is
     passed in 'arg'.  You can use this to find out whether some process
     still exists.

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_PGRP'
     Return all processes in process group PGRP which is passed in
     'arg'.

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_SESSION'
     Return all processes in session SESSION which is passed in 'arg'.

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_TTY'
     Return all processes which have the controlling tty TTY which is
     passed in 'arg' (TTY is interpreted as device number).

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_UID'
     Return all processes with effective uid UID which is passed in
     'arg'.

'GLIBTOP_KERN_PROC_RUID'
     Return all processes with real uid RUID which is passed in 'arg'.

   You can alter the list of returned processes by using a binary OR of
'which' and the following constants:

'GLIBTOP_EXCLUDE_IDLE'
     Exclude idle processes.
'GLIBTOP_EXCLUDE_SYSTEM'
     Exclude system processes.
'GLIBTOP_EXCLUDE_NOTTY'
     Exclude processes without a controlling terminal.

   The return value of 'glibtop_get_proclist' is either 'NULL' on error
or a 'unsigned *' list of pids.  Additionally, the following fields of
'glibtop_proclist' are set:

'number'
     Number of entries in the returned list.

'total'
     Total size of the returned list (this equals 'number * size').

'size'
     Size of a single entry in the returned list (this equals 'sizeof
     (unsigned)').

   The returned list is allocated using 'g_malloc' and must be freed
using 'g_free' to avoid a memory leak.

             last_processor;

     };

'cmd'
     Basename of the executable file in the call to 'exec'.
'state'
     Process state ('R' = running, 'S' = sleeping, 'D' =
     uninterruptible, 'Z' = zombie, 'T' = stopped, 'I' = idle).

     This was changed to an 'unsigned' bitfield in LibGTop 1.1.x where
     there are also some constants for it.

   When porting LibGTop, please _try hard_ to implement the following
fields.  For security reasons, it is *very important* that you *only*
set the 'flags' bits for those fields if their *values are correct*.

'uid'
     Effective UID of the process.
'gid'
     Effective GID of the process.
'ruid'
     Real UID of the process.
'rgid'
     Read GID of the process.

   The following fields are for SMP systems:

'has_cpu'
     This is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the process currently
     has a CPU or not.

'processor'
     This is the processor id of the CPU this process is currently
     running on (which can be used as index in the 'xcpu_' fields of
     'glibtop_cpu' for instance; since zero is a valid processor id, you
     must check 'has_cpu' in this case to find out whether the process
     really has a CPU).

'last_processor'
     The is the processor id of the CPU the process was last running on.

'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_RUNNING'
     The process is currently running.
'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_INTERRUPTIBLE'
     The process is currently in an interruptible sleep.
'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_UNINTERRUPTIBLE'
     The process is currently in uninterruptible sleep (the so-called
     "disk sleep").
'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_ZOMBIE'
     The process is a zombie.
'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_STOPPED'
     The process is currently stopped (received 'SIGSTOP' or attached to
     a debugger).
'GLIBTOP_PROCESS_SWAPPING'
     The process is currently swapping.

     struct _glibtop_proc_mem
     {
         guint64   flags,

             vsize,
             resident,
             share,
             rss,
             rss_rlim;
     };

'size'
     Total number of pages of memory.
'vsize'
     Number of pages of virtual memory.
'resident'
     Number of residnet set (non-swapped) pages.
'share'
     Number of pages of shared (mmap\'d) memory.
'rss'
     Number of pages the process has in real memory, minus 3 for
     administrative purposes.

     This is just the pages which count towards text, data, or stack
     space.  This does not include pages which have not been
     demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.
'rss_rlim'
     Current limit in bytes on the rss of the process (usually
     2,147,483,647).

   The description above is taken from the manual page of the '/proc'
filesystem under Linux and is a little bit confusing, so I make this
clear here.

   *A word for people porting LibGTop to other systems:* Every operating
system has its own idea about the memory usage of a process and also
system utilities like 'ps' show different things on different systems.

   Nevertheless, we should try to make LibGTop as system independent as
possible, so I give you some hints here how 'glibtop_get_proc_mem'
should work.

   * When you use 'mmap' with either 'MAP_SHARED' or 'MAP_PRIVATE', this
     should only affect the 'vsize' of the process and none of its
     'size', 'resident', 'shared' and 'rss' sizes.

   * As soon as you read some of the 'mmap()'ed pages, they will be
     demand- oaded and thus count towards the 'size' of the process.

     Also - we assume there is enough free memory - they are resident in
     memory until they get stolen or swapped out and thus increase the
     'resident' and 'rss' sizes of the process.

   * If the process has used 'MAP_SHARED' and another process attaches
     the same file also 'MAP_SHARED', some of the pages are shared with
     this process and thus increase the 'shared' sizes of both
     processes.

   * If the process has used 'MAP_PRIVATE' and writes to the 'mmap()'ed
     pages, the only difference to reading from them is that they get
     dirty and cannot be stolen any longer but will get swapped out.

   * When memory gets rare, clean pages are normally stolen, which
     decreases the 'size', 'resident', 'shared' and 'rss' sizes of the
     process.

   * When dirty pages are swapped out, this will not decrease the 'size'
     of the process but only its 'resident' and 'rss' sizes (dirty pages
     cannot be shared).

   * The 'vsize' of a process can _only_ be changed by the process
     itself when it requests or frees memory but _never_ due to swapping
     activity of the system.

   * If the 'shared' size changes, this _only_ means that the number of
     pages that are currently shared with other processes has changed;
     if this happens, this will _never_ affect any of the other sizes of
     the process.

   The hints above describe how it works under Linux - but we should try
to make 'glibtop_get_proc_mem' show the same behavior under every other
system.

             xcpu_flags;
     };

'start_time'
     Start time of process in seconds since the epoch
'rtime'
     Real time accumulated by process (should be 'utime' + 'stime')
'utime'

'stime'
     Kernel-mode CPU time accumulated by process
'cutime'
     Cumulative utime of process and reaped children
'cstime'
     Cumulative stime of process and reaped children
'timeout'
     The time (in jiffies) of the process's next timeout
'it_real_value'
     The time (in jiffies) before the next SIGALRM is sent to the
     process due to an interval timer.
'frequency'
     Tick frequency
'xcpu_utime'
     SMP user-mode CPU time accumulated by process
'xcpu_stime'
     SMP kernel-mode CPU time accumulated by process

   Please note that under Linux, 'start_time' value may be strange.
Linux kernel defines 'INITIAL_JIFFIES' which implies a time shift.
Because 'INITIAL_JIFFIES' is not user-space defined, we cannot use it to
compute accurate 'start_time'.  On Linux2.6, 'INITIAL_JIFFIES' is 300 so
'start_time' is always 3s different from real start time of the given
process.  You may also get shift results if your system clock is not
synchronised with your hardware clock.  See 'man hwclock'.

     glibtop_mountentry *
     glibtop_get_mountlist (glibtop_mountlist *buf, int all_fs);

   The 'all_fs' parameter specifies whether information about all
filesystems should be returned; this will include filesystem types like
'autofs' and 'procfs'.  You should not use this in disk usage programs,
but it can be useful to get a list of all currently mounted filesystems.

     };

   Returns a 'glibtop_mountentry *' list (which needs to be freed with
'g_free') of mounted filesystems.

'number'
     Number of entries in the returned list.

'total'
     Total size of the returned list (this equals 'number * size').

'size'
     Size of a single entry in the returned list (this equals 'sizeof

     };

   'GLIBTOP_MOUNTENTRY_LEN' is defined in '<glibtop.h>'.

'devname'
     Full pathname (such as '/dev/sdb1' for instance) to the mounted
     device.
'mountdir'
     Full pathname of the mountpoint (such as '/usr/local' for
     instance).

3.3 Library Functions
=====================

This are general library functions which can be used to get information
about the library and to control its behavior.

* Menu:

* glibtop_init::                Server Initialization.
* glibtop_sysdeps::             Server Sysdeps.
* Library Parameters::          Library Parameters.


File: libgtop2.info,  Node: glibtop_init,  Next: glibtop_sysdeps,  Prev: Library Functions,  Up: Library Functions

3.3.1 Server Initialization
---------------------------

You do not need to worry about the 'glibtop *' server structure if you
don't need - the library exports a 'glibtop_global_server' which you can
use everywhere a 'glibtop *' is expected.

   Most of the library and all of the sysdeps function also have an
alias (which is the function name without the '_l', '_s' or '_r' suffix)
which don't take a 'glibtop *' as argument but uses the
'glibtop_global_server' instead.

     extern glibtop *glibtop_global_server;

   Library function 'glibtop_init':

     glibtop *
     glibtop_init_r (glibtop **server_ptr, unsigned long features,
                     unsigned flags);

     void
     glibtop_init (void);

   This function initializes a LibGTop server.  It is automatically
called when you use any of the LibGTop functions and will use the global
server in this case.

   However, it's appreciated to call 'glibtop_init' during the
initialization of your application.

   You can for instance use

     glibtop_init ();

which is equivalent to

     glibtop_init_r (&glibtop_global_server, 0, 0);

   Please note that the 'server_ptr' argument is a pointer to a pointer
(and thus is of type 'glibtop **').

   To control what 'glibtop_init' should actually do, you can use the
'features' and 'flags' arguments.

   The 'features' argument is a bit-mask (interpreted in the same way
than 'sysdeps.features') and tells the library which features you're
interested in.  The library will only start the server if this is
required for any of those features.

   You can use the following constants for the 'flags' parameter to
control the behavior of the library:

'GLIBTOP_INIT_NO_INIT'
     Tells the library to do nothing.  If the value pointed to by the
     'server_ptr' argument is 'NULL', it will set it to the
     'glibtop_global_server' and then return.
'GLIBTOP_INIT_NO_OPEN'
     Do the initialization, but do not start the server.

   To modify the way the 'features' are interpretet, you can use the
following constants for 'flags' (as a bit mask):

'GLIBTOP_FEATURES_NO_SERVER'
     Never use the server, always call the sysdeps code directly.  If
     you require any privileges to get them and you don't have those
     privileges, the this will obviously not work and the library will
     fail to return some or all of the requested values.
'GLIBTOP_FEATURES_EXCEPT'
     Inverts the matching of the 'features' parameter, i.e.  if you use
     this flag this means that 'features' are all the features you are
     _not_ interested in.  Might be useful to say something like "I want
     everything but ppp".

             fsusage,
             netload,
             ppp;
     };

'features'
     This is a bit field (the so-called "server features") stating for
     which features we need to use the server.
'pointer_size'
     This was added in LibGTop 1.1.0 and tells you the number of bits a
     'void*' has in the server (this may be different from the size on
     the client machine if we're talking over the daemon to a remove
     machine).

   The following constants from '<glibtop/sysdeps.h>' serve as
bit-indices for the 'features' field:

     #define GLIBTOP_SYSDEPS_CPU             0
     #define GLIBTOP_SYSDEPS_MEM             1

3.3.3 Library Parameters
------------------------

Library function 'glibtop_get_parameter':

     size_t
     glibtop_get_parameter_l (glibtop *server, const unsigned parameter,
                              void *data_ptr, size_t data_size);

     size_t
     glibtop_get_parameter (const unsigned parameter, void *data_ptr,
                            size_t data_size);

   This function is used to retrieve a library parameter (see below for
a more detailed description).  It returns the size of the retrieved
parameter on success, zero on failure or minus the actual size of the
parameter if 'data_size' was too small.

   You may call this function with 'data_ptr' set to 'NULL' to get the
actual size of a parameter (as a negative value).

'parameter'
     The parameter you want to retrieve (see below for constants).
'data_ptr'
     Pointer to a place where the parameter should be stored.
'data_size'
     Maximum size of the parameter.

   Library function 'glibtop_set_parameter':

     void
     glibtop_set_parameter_l (glibtop *server, const unsigned parameter,
                              const void *data_ptr, size_t data_size);

     void
     glibtop_set_parameter (const unsigned parameter, const void *data_ptr,
                            size_t data_size);

   This function is used to modify a library parameter.  Please not that
you may not set all parameters since some of them are read-only.

'parameter'
     The parameter you want to modify (see below for constants).
'data_ptr'
     Pointer to the value which should be set.
'data_size'
     Size of the new value.  For fixed-size parameters, this must match
     the exact size of the parameter or you'll get an error.

   The following parameters are defined in '<glibtop/parameter.h>':

'GLIBTOP_PARAM_FEATURES'
     This is a read-only 'unsigned long' representing the 'features'
     field of 'glibtop_sysdeps'.
'GLIBTOP_PARAM_REQUIRED'
     This is a 'glibtop_sysdeps' structure specifying which features the
     client requires the library return.  If it fails to get any of
     them, you'll get an error.
'GLIBTOP_PARAM_ERROR_METHOD'
     This is an 'unsigned' telling the library what to do if it fails to
     get any of the features that are marked as required via the
     'GLIBTOP_PARAM_REQUIRED' parameter (see below for constants).

   You can use the following constants for 'GLIBTOP_PARAM_ERROR_METHOD'
(defined in '<glibtop/open.h>'):

'GLIBTOP_ERROR_METHOD_IGNORE'
     Ignore the error condition.
'GLIBTOP_ERROR_METHOD_WARN_ONCE'
     Warn once about the absense of some of the required features, then
     modify 'GLIBTOP_PARAM_REQUIRED' so that the missing ones are no
     longer required.  This is the prefered value for applications since
     it'll only print out the warning message once and not each time the
     library tries to get one of those features.
'GLIBTOP_ERROR_METHOD_WARN'
     Warn each time the library fails to get some of the required
     features.
'GLIBTOP_ERROR_METHOD_ABORT'
     Abort if the library fails to get some of the required features.
     This should not be used by applications.
