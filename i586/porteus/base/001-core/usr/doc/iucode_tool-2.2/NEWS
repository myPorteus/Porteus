v2.2:
  * build infrastructure changes: autoconf 2.69 or later, and
    automake 1.13 or later are now required.  The configure script
    will attempt to auto-detect and enable several warning and
    hardening options by default if CFLAGS/LDFLAGS are *unset*, or if
    given the new --enable-extend-flags option.  "-O3" optimization
    mode will be used by default.  The usual ways to override *FLAGS
    are respected by configure and the Makefile.

v2.1.1:
  * Fix CVE-2017-0357: iucode_tool: heap buffer overflow on -tr loader

v2.1:
  * The early initramfs cpio archives created by iucode_tool are now
    deterministic.  Instead of the current system time, the date of
    the latest microcode included in the early initramfs will be used.
  * There is a new option to minimize the size of the early initramfs:
    --mini-earlyfw.  This option causes iucode_tool to create a non-
    standard cpio archive which is typically 736 bytes smaller.
    WARNING: the microcode data file might not be visible to the
    regular initramfs when this mode is used.
  * iucode-tool will now create valid early initramfs archives past
    year 2038.

v2.0:
  * This new major version has several non-backwards-compatible
    changes.  Scripts that scrape iucode_tool's stdout/stderr messages
    might have to be updated, and the behavior for -s and -S options
    changed.
    * The microcode listing output format used by --list and
      --list-all changed: the processor flags mask field is now
      labeled "pf_mask" instead of "pf mask", and the first field
      (bundle id/microcode id) is wider for --list-all, and completely
      changed for --list (refer to next entry).
    * The output for the --list option now uses the same microcode
      numbering used in --list-all and error messages, and also the
      same indentation as --list-all.  For this reason, --list will
      output the bundle assignment list to stdout when not in --quiet
      mode, the same way --list-all does.
    * The --scan-system/-S option can now only be specified once, and
      it may be overridden by -s !<signature> options that come
      *after* it in command line ordering.  To emulate the previous
      behavior, always specify --scan-system just once, and as the
      last option (i.e. after any -s options).
    * Error and warning messages, as well as some verbose (and debug)
      messages were updated, and some of them were demoted to higher
      verbosity levels.
  * Other relevant changes since v1.6.1:
    * Microcodes are now sorted by signature (ascending) and processor
      flags mask (descending).  Before, microcodes with the same
      signature but different processor flags mask had unspecified
      ordering.
    * The .dat format loader was optimized to run a lot faster on
      files that match the Intel layout exactly, and improved its
      error detection.
    * iucode_tool now flushes output data files to permanent storage
      using fdatasync() before closing them, to better detect write
      errors.  This causes a performance hit, but it is much safer.
    * Fix large file support (LFS) on 32-bit builds.
    * Abort with an error when attempting to write more than 4GiB to a
      cpio (early initramfs) archive, due to a limitation of that cpio
      file format.

v1.6.1:
  * Memory usage was greatly reduced when processing large microcode
    bundles.

v1.6:
  * Fix --scan-system to properly support mixed-stepping systems
    (broken since v1.2, partially fixed in v1.5.2).

v1.5:
  * There is a new option to write out microcodes, capable of writing
    out every revision of every microcode: --write-all-named-to.  All
    other write out options will only output a single revision of a
    microcode.  Refer to the manpage for details.

v1.4:
  * There is a new file type loader: -tr (recover microcode in
    binary format), which searches for valid microcodes in Intel
    binary format anywhere inside a binary file.

    For standard, undamaged microcode data files, the default
    binary loader (-tb) should be used instead: it is faster, and
    it will properly complain of data file corruption.  Refer to
    the manpage for details.

v1.3:
  * The .dat file loader was fixed to properly report IO errors, and
    enhanced to report the number of the line that caused a syntax
    error, as well as to accept comments at the end of a line.
    Before, comments had to be on a line of their own.  Note that
    the .dat file loader assumes all comments start with / and span
    to the end of line.
  * It is now safe to call iucode_tool with stdin, stdout or stderr
    closed: /dev/null will be used, instead.

v1.2.1:
  * Due to gitorious.org planned shutdown at the end of 2015-05,
    iucode-tool has a new home at gitlab:

    https://gitlab.com/iucode-tool

    The old home at Debian Alioth will remain as a backup location:
    http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/hmh/intel-microcode.git

v1.2:
  * Scalability improvement for --scan-system: by compile-time
    default, use the cpuid instruction directly on the running
    processor, and assume all other cores have the same
    signature.  The code now depends on gcc's cpuid.h header.

v1.1:
  * Working support for extended signature tables

v1.0.2:
  * iucode-tool has a new home at gitorious:
    https://gitorious.org/iucode-tool

    The old home at Debian Alioth will remain as a backup location:
    http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/hmh/intel-microcode.git

v1.0:
  * Added --write-earlyfw, useful to support microcode
    updates during very early boot (kernel support added in
    Linux v3.9)
  * iucode_tool has implemented the most important features
    it currently needs, bump the major version number to 1.

v0.9:
  * Added -s! and --lose-date-filtering options, described in
    the iucode_tool(8) manpage.
